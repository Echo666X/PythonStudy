# Summary: in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about Python variables and how to use them effectively.

#in Python,a variable is a label that you can assign a valuen to it
# to define a variable,you can use the following syntax

variable_name = value1
# "=" is the assignment operator

# the naming rules:
#     Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
#     They can start with a letter or an underscore (_), 
#     not with a number.
#     Variable names cannot contain spaces.
#     To separate words in variables, 
#     you use underscores for example sorted_list.
#     Variable names cannot be the same as keywords, 
#     reserved words, and built-in functions in Python.
