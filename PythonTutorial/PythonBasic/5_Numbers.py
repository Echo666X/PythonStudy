#Summary: in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about Python numbers and how to use them in programs.

n = 20 + 10
print(n)
n = 20 - 10
print(n)
n = 20 * 10
print(n)

# the division of two integers always returns a float
# for example:
n = 20 / 10
print(n)
# the result is 2.0
# in addition to this,if you mix an integer and a float in any arithmetic operation ,the result is also a float

#To calculate exponents,you use two multiplication(**)
n = 4**2
print(n)

# a long numbers is always hard to read,to make it more readable,you can group digits using underscores
n = 10_0000_0000
print(n)
