# in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about the Python while else statement and how to use it effectively.
# in python, the condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration, the code block inside the while statement will execute as long as the condition is true
# when the condition becomes false and the loop runs normally, the else clause will execute
# if the loop is terminated permaturely by either a break or return statement, the else clause won't execute.
