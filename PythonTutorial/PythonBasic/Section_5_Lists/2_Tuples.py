# in this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn about Python tuples and how to use them effectively.
# sometimes you want to create a list of items that cannot be changed throughout the program, tuples allows you to do that.
# so by definition, a tuple is an immutable list.

# the tuple is like a list except that it uses parenthese() instead of square brackets[]
rgb = ('red','green','blue')
print(rgb[0],rgb[1],rgb[2],sep=",")
